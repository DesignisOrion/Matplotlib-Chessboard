# Matplotlib Chessboard

### About 
A project displaying a chessboard made from Matplotlib

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Matplotlib

### What I learned:

Matplotlib is a powerful libary. It is a Python library used for plotting graphs with the help of other libraries like Numpy and Pandas. It is a powerful tool for visualizing data in Python. It is used for creating statistical inferences and plotting 2D graphs of arrays.

In this project I was able to learn about the colors module within Matplotlib. (Matplotlib.colors) and LogNorm. This module includes functions and classes for color specification conversions, and for mapping numbers to colors in a 1-D array of colors called a colormap. This was a tedious job of learning how to place the squares correclty and also geting the color to have that purple tint included. This libary of Matplotlib shows that data visualization can be achieved even with projects like so. Enjoy!
